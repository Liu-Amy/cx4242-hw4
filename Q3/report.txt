****************************************
Part C

For your SVM's CV run from part B, state the highest mean testing accuracy 
across the sets of parameter values and its corresponding mean train score and mean fit time. 

SVM's highest mean testing/cross-validated accuracy: 
SVM's mean train score: 
SVM's mean fit time:

Part D

Tuned SVM's testing accuracy BEFORE preprocessing: 
Tuned SVM's testing accuracy AFTER preprocessing: 
Why you think it increased, decreased, or stayed the same:
